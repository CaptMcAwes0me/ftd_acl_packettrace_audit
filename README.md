# 🧱 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit

Audit Cisco FTD ACLs by auto-expanding objects and running `packet-tracer` tests per rule.  
The script parses each access-list line, resolves object/object-group members, determines the correct ingress interface per source IP via routing lookups, and executes representative `packet-tracer` commands.

**Results are automatically saved to CSV files for easy analysis and reporting.**

It then reports:
- Whether traffic was **allowed / denied / unknown**
- Whether it was **allowed by this exact ACE (✅)** or by a **different ACE (🟡)**, using `rule-id` lines from `packet-tracer` output.
- **ACL shadowing issues** (optional) - detects when rules are shadowed by earlier rules

> ⚠️ **Read-only:** This tool only runs `show` and `packet-tracer` commands — it never modifies configuration.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 CSV Output (Always Enabled)
- **results.csv**: Complete test results with rule names and details
- **results_flagged.csv**: Only tests that didn't match expected ACE (for quick issue review)
- **results_untested.csv**: Rules parsed but generated 0 tests (with diagnostic reasons)
- **results_fmc_rule_expansions.csv**: Shows how FMC rules expand into multiple ACL entries
- **by_matched_rule/**: Per-rule CSVs grouped by which rule was actually matched (for focused troubleshooting)
- **results_shadowing.csv**: ACL shadowing detection report (when enabled)
- **ZIP archive**: All output files automatically compressed for easy sharing
- Easy to import into Excel, databases, or analysis tools

### ⚙️ Multi-Threaded Testing
- Parallel packet-tracer execution with the ACL_PT_WORKERS variable (default: 16).
- Thread-safe logging and shared route cache for performance.
- Configurable worker count for optimal performance on your system.

### 🧭 Dynamic Ingress Detection
- Uses show route <src_ip> to identify ingress interfaces.
- Falls back to default route when route lookup fails or returns unparseable results.
- Optional static fallback via ACL_PT_DEFAULT_IF.
- Cached route lookups for improved performance.

### 🧩 Full Object Expansion
- Recursively expands network and service object-groups, including nested groups.
- Handles object, object-group, range, and fqdn types (skips unresolved FQDNs with warnings).
- Maps named services (http, https, ssh, etc.) to ports automatically.
- Supports inline port specifications (eq, range, lt, gt, neq) in ACL lines.
- Resolves service object-groups in protocol position (e.g., `permit object-group ICMP-ALL`).
- Protocol-aware service resolution for accurate port mapping.

### 🧠 Rule Context Awareness
- Parses rule-id and related remark lines (e.g., L7 RULE: or ACCESS POLICY:).
- Identifies whether the matching ACE was the current rule or another.
- Displays friendly rule names in summaries when available.

### 🔍 Rich Result Context
- Extracts Action, Drop-reason, and matched ACE from packet-tracer output.
- Annotates each test with ACL phase information:
  - matched this ACE • by <ACL> rule-id <id> '<name>' • [drop-reason].
- Detailed skip diagnostics showing why rules weren't tested.
- FMC rule expansion tracking (explains why 565 ACL lines = 250 unique rules).

### 🧾 Structured Artifacts
- **CSV files (always created)**: Complete results, flagged results, and shadowing report
- Per-rule logs: rule_<id>.log (when ACL_PT_LOG=1)
- JSONL format with every probe result (when ACL_PT_LOG=1)
- Timestamped run directory for each execution.

### 🔍 Shadow Detection (Optional)
- Detects ACL rule shadowing by testing each rule's IPs against earlier rules
- Identifies when specific rules are shadowed by broader rules
- Finds partially shadowed rules that may cause unexpected behavior
- Enable with ACL_PT_SHADOW_DETECT=1

### ⏱️ Performance Metrics
- Execution time tracking with human-readable format
- Throughput statistics (tests per second)
- Progress indicators during parsing and testing phases

### 🧰 Flexible Output Modes
- **summary (default)** – Clean progress indicators with final statistics
- **verbose** – Prints every packet-tracer command and outcome
- **debug** – Adds previews of object, route, and parsing stages
- Minimal console output with comprehensive CSV reporting

### 🚦 Per-Rule Summary with Icons
- ✅ **ALLOW (matched this ACE)**
- 🟡 **A different ACE matched first**
- ⛔ **DENY** — the packet-tracer’s final **Action** was *drop*. This can be an ACL decision (explicit deny or default rule) or another control (prefilter/security policy, NAT/routing, inspection/state, zone/interface). When available, the script shows the denying ACE (`rule-id`); otherwise check the `Drop-reason:` in the output.
- ❓ **UNKNOWN (no clear result parsed)**

### 🧪 Sensible Sampling
- **ICMP:** `echo-request` (type 8, code 0) using order `src type code dst`.
- **TCP/UDP:** Tests representative ports from service groups
- **Service any:** Uses configurable defaults (80 for TCP, 53 for UDP via env vars)
- Warnings when port ranges are truncated for testing

### 🎨 Optional ANSI Colors
Disable with:
```bash
export ACL_PT_COLOR=0
```

## 📦 Requirements

- Run on the **FTD (Firepower)** device in expert shell (e.g., `root@firepower`).
- Python 3 must be installed on the device.
- `ConvergedCliClient` must exist in `$PATH`.
- Privileges to run `show` and `packet-tracer` are required.

---

## 🚀 Installation

You can run the script directly on your Cisco FTD device (expert shell).  
Ensure that both `python3` and `ConvergedCliClient` are available.

### 1️⃣ Copy the script to your FTD
```bash
scp ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py admin@firepower:/home/admin/
```

### 2️⃣ (Optional) Make it executable
```bash
ssh admin@firepower
chmod +x /home/admin/ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```

### 3️⃣ Verify prerequisites
```bash
which python3
which ConvergedCliClient
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

You can control verbosity, color, and limits using environment variables.

### 🧩 Basic Run (CSV output always created)
```bash
python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```
Output:
- `/var/tmp/acl_packet_tracer_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/results.csv`
- `/var/tmp/acl_packet_tracer_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/results_flagged.csv`
- `/var/tmp/acl_packet_tracer_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/results_fmc_rule_expansions.csv`
- `/var/tmp/acl_packet_tracer_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip` (all files compressed)

### 🗣️ Verbose / Debug Modes
Show each `packet-tracer` command and result:
```bash
ACL_PT_PRINT_MODE=verbose python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```

### 📝 Enable Detailed Logging (opt-in)
Write per-ACE logs + JSONL to /var/tmp:
```bash
ACL_PT_LOG=1 python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```
Choose a custom directory:
```bash
ACL_PT_LOG=1 ACL_PT_LOG_DIR=/var/tmp/ftd_audit_runs python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```
Include `[DBG]` previews (routes, objects, etc.):
```bash
ACL_PT_PRINT_MODE=debug python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```

### 🚀 Performance Tuning
Increase concurrent packet-tracer threads (default: 16):
```bash
ACL_PT_WORKERS=32 python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```
Recommendations:
- **16 workers** (default): Good for most systems
- **24-32 workers**: High-performance systems
- **8 workers**: Conservative, if experiencing timeouts

### 🔍 Shadow Detection (Comprehensive ACL Analysis)
Detect ACL rule shadowing:
```bash
ACL_PT_SHADOW_DETECT=1 python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```
This tests each rule's IPs against all earlier rules to find shadowing issues.
**Note:** Significantly increases execution time (O(n²) complexity).

Combine with performance tuning:
```bash
ACL_PT_SHADOW_DETECT=1 ACL_PT_WORKERS=32 python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```

### 🎨 Disable Color
```bash
ACL_PT_COLOR=0 python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```

### ⚙️ Limit Flagged Prints
Show only the first 50 flagged results (🟡 / ⛔ / ❓):
```bash
ACL_PT_MAX_FLAG_PRINT=50 python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```

### 🌐 Provide a Fallback Ingress Interface
Used if route lookup fails:
```bash
export ACL_PT_DEFAULT_IF=Your-Ingress-Interface
python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```

### 🎛️ Configure Default Test Ports
Customize default ports for "any" service:
```bash
ACL_PT_DEFAULT_TCP_PORT=443 ACL_PT_DEFAULT_UDP_PORT=161 python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
```

> 💡 Combine options for comprehensive audits:
> ```bash
> ACL_PT_SHADOW_DETECT=1 ACL_PT_WORKERS=32 ACL_PT_LOG=1 python3 ftd_acl_packettrace_audit.py
> ```

### 🔣 Icon Meanings
- ✅ **Allowed by this ACE** (your ACL and rule-id appear in `Config:` block)
- 🟡 **Allowed by a different ACE** (earlier/broader match or different policy layer)
- ⛔ **Denied**
- ❓ **Unknown** (no clear `Result:` line or unrecognized format)

When anything other than ✅ occurs, the script prints the exact `packet-tracer` command so you can reproduce it manually.

## 🧠 How It Works (High Level)

### 1️⃣ Collect ACLs
```bash
show running-config access-list | exclude remark
```

### 2️⃣ Parse Each Rule
- Extract protocol, source, destination, service, rule-id, and optional interface.
- Handle service object-groups in protocol position (e.g., `permit object-group ICMP-ALL`).
- Parse inline port specifications (eq, range, lt, gt, neq) in ACL lines.
- Expand network objects and nested groups using:
  ```bash
  show running-config object-group id <name>
  show running-config object id <name>
  ```
- Resolve service ports with protocol context for accurate mapping.
- Track FMC rule expansions (single FMC rule → multiple ACL entries).

### 3️⃣ Determine Ingress per Source IP
```bash
show route <src_ip>
```
If `% Network not in table`, fall back to:
```bash
show route 0.0.0.0
```

### 4️⃣ Run Packet-Tracers
```bash
# ICMP
packet-tracer input <if> icmp <src> 8 0 <dst>

# TCP / UDP
packet-tracer input <if> <proto> <src> 12345 <dst> <dport>
```

### 5️⃣ Parse and Summarize Results
- Identify matched ACE (prefer `rule-id` in `Config:` block).  
- Summarize results to console and export per-rule logs, CSV, and JSONL.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **No output:** Ensure `ConvergedCliClient` is callable, you're in expert shell, and Python 3 is installed.  
- **Script appears frozen:** Check if it's parsing rules (should show progress). Large ACLs with many object-groups can take time to resolve.
- **Ingress names look odd:** Parser ignores literal word `interface` and prefers `via <IF>` lines.  
  If you still see unexpected names, capture `show route <src_ip>` and open an issue with the snippet.  
- **Default route being used:** Default route is now used when route lookup fails or returns unparseable results.
- **ICMP syntax errors:** Ensure order `src type code dst`; script uses `8 0` (echo-request).  
- **Too many flagged prints:** Reduce `ACL_PT_MAX_FLAG_PRINT` or switch to summary mode.
- **Timeouts occurring:** Reduce `ACL_PT_WORKERS` to 8 or lower to decrease system load.
- **Shadow detection too slow:** This is expected (O(n²) complexity). Use only for periodic comprehensive audits.
- **CSV files not created:** Check permissions on `/var/tmp` or set `ACL_PT_LOG_DIR` to a writable location.
- **Wrong ports being tested:** Ensure service object-groups are properly defined. Check `results_fmc_rule_expansions.csv` to see how rules expanded.
- **FQDN objects skipped:** FQDNs require DNS resolution (not implemented). Rules with only FQDN objects will be skipped with warnings.
- **Rules showing as "untested":** Check `results_untested.csv` for diagnostic reasons (no ingress interface, empty objects, etc.).
- **Unique rule count lower than expected:** FMC expands multi-service rules into multiple ACL entries. See `results_fmc_rule_expansions.csv`.
